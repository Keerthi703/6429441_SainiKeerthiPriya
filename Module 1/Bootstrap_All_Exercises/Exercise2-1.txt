When we download Bootstrap manually, we'll typically get a folder structure like this:

bootstrap/
├── css/
├── js/
└── icons/ (optional, if Bootstrap Icons are included)
Here’s a breakdown of each folder and its purpose:

📁 1. css/ – Cascading Style Sheets
This folder contains all the Bootstrap stylesheets, which define how elements look.

Common files inside:

bootstrap.css: The full, unminified Bootstrap CSS.

bootstrap.min.css: The minified version (smaller file size for production).

bootstrap.rtl.css / bootstrap.rtl.min.css: CSS with right-to-left (RTL) support for languages like Arabic or Hebrew.

bootstrap-grid.css / bootstrap-grid.min.css: Only the grid system, without other Bootstrap components.

bootstrap-reboot.css: A modern CSS reset to normalize browser styles.

Purpose:
These stylesheets control the layout, spacing, colors, typography, buttons, forms, etc., that Bootstrap offers.

📁 2. js/ – JavaScript Files
This folder contains Bootstrap’s JavaScript plugins that add interactivity.

Common files inside:

bootstrap.bundle.js: Includes all Bootstrap JavaScript plugins plus Popper.js (needed for tooltips, dropdowns, etc.).

bootstrap.bundle.min.js: The minified version for production.

bootstrap.js / bootstrap.min.js: Bootstrap plugins without Popper (requires you to include Popper separately if needed).

Purpose:
Handles interactivity like modals, carousels, dropdowns, tooltips, collapse (for navbars, accordions), etc.

📁 3. icons/ – Bootstrap Icons (if included)
This optional folder contains SVG icons from the Bootstrap Icons library.

Common files inside:

Individual .svg icon files

bootstrap-icons.css and bootstrap-icons.woff or .woff2: Used if you're loading icons via CSS.
